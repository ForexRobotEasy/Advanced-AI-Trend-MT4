This code implements the necessary trade functions and features for the Advanced AI Trend MT4 product.

Note: This code is solely focused on the code requirements for developing the Advanced AI Trend MT4 product.

## Code Description

### Libraries Used

This code utilizes the following libraries:

1. `Trade.mqh` - Provides necessary trade functions.
2. `MachineLearning.mqh` - Provides machine learning algorithms.

### Constants

The following constants are defined:

1. `RISK_PERCENTAGE` - The risk percentage for position sizing.
2. `TP_DISTANCE` - The take profit distance in pips.
3. `SL_DISTANCE` - The stop loss distance in pips.
4. `MIN_SESSION_DATA` - The minimum number of bars required for analysis.
5. `SCALPING_TIME_FRAME` - The time frame used for scalping strategies.

### Initialization

The code initializes the `CTrade` class and the `CMachineLearning` class in the `OnInit()` function.

### Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function deinitializes the `CTrade` class and the `CMachineLearning` class.

### Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is executed on each tick. It performs the following steps:

1. Checks if there is enough data to analyze.
2. Calculates the entry and exit points using smart algorithms.
3. Calculates the position size based on the risk percentage.
4. Places a buy position using the calculated entry price, position size, take profit distance, and stop loss distance.
5. Monitors the trade using the calculated exit price.
6. Closes the trade if necessary.

### Start Function

The `OnStart()` function runs the Expert Advisor indefinitely by calling the `OnTick()` function repeatedly with a delay of 1 second.
